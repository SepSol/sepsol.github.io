          <p>
            Hello! I'm Sepehr, a full-stack software engineer and web developer
            based in San Francisco Bay Area, CA.
          </p>
          <p>
            I love tech and have been a tech-enthusiast since 7 years ago, and
            recently I decided to roll up my sleeves and be the builder of the
            things that have always interested me. During the past 4 years, I've
            founded and worked for different startups in various positions,
            which allowed me to meet many nice talented people and
            entrepreneurs.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have worked with a lot of popular software programs before
            becoming a developer and one of the most valuable skills I've
            learned from my past journey, is how to find high-quality resources
            and link myself to appropriate people to learn new skills. I
            recognize myself as a fast-learner, and you don't have to take my
            word for it! I was well-known at my university for my well-rounded
            research and presentation on various subjects. Plus, here's how my
            previous employer describes me in my recommendation letter:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            We think that Sepehr has a high speed in learning programming
            concepts.
            <footer>Sina Maleki</footer>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            As a software engineer, I enjoy using my skills to make innovative
            things that solve real-world problems and I love to bridge the gap
            between engineering and design.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I'm not working, I either watch YouTube for fun or to expand my
            knowledge, play with the UI/UX of other apps and try to come up with
            my twist on their concept, or sometimes play video games :)
          </p>
